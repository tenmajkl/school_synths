# Synthesizers

School project of listing synths

## make it happen

```c
make
```

## IDEAS

so if we make our aarray by default array of pointers to structs, we can have only one struct and use it for filters and stuff! this would only mean to use different allocations.

TODO consultate it with Martinek

ok its better to have 2 arrays

array of synths would also have array of indexes, function returning eg. filter would return synthesizer list, but with different indexes

also think of rollbacks, colors

OK we have list of indexes, now adapt the code

probably make it clener
